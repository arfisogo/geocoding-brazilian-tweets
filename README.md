# Geocoding Brazilian Tweets using Text Pattern Recognition

## Overview
Developed a Python-based framework to infer geographic location of Brazilian Twitter users by combining tweet metadata and text pattern recognition. The solution addresses missing or unstructured location fields and achieved over 97% positive predictive value at municipality level.


## Problem
Twitter users rarely provide structured geographic information, limiting spatial analysis of social media data.

## Data
Description of the Twitter data used, metadata fields, and preprocessing steps.

## Methodology
Explanation of text normalization, pattern recognition, heuristics, and geocoding logic.

## Results
Main metrics and performance results.

## Limitations
Known challenges and edge cases.

## Technologies
Python, Pandas, Regex, NLP techniques, Twitter API.

## Future Improvements
Possible extensions and improvements.
